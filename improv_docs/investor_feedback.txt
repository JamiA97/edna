As an investor evaluating eng-dna, my verdict is that you have identified a highly valuable, unaddressed market niche, but the current implementation is a "tool," not yet a "business."

Here is the brutally honest feedback on the commercial merits of this system.

1. The "Unfair Advantage" (Why this is compelling)
You have stumbled upon a proven architectural pattern that has created unicorns in other verticals, but is missing in hardware.

The "DVC for Hardware" Play: In the Machine Learning world, a tool called DVC (Data Version Control) does exactly what you are proposing: it uses Git for code but manages large data files and their lineage separately. DVC is a massive success because it lets data scientists use standard software tools (Git) without breaking them.

You are solving the "PLM Hate" Problem: Traditional PLM (Teamcenter, Windchill) is universally loathed by engineers for being slow, rigid, and expensive. "Agile Hardware" teams (drones, robotics, EVs) are desperate for a lightweight alternative. Your "local-first" approach creates zero friction for adoption, which is the holy grail of Product-Led Growth (PLG).

Blue Ocean: Current "Modern PLM" tools like AllSpice.io or CoLab are cloud-heavy "GitHub for Hardware" replacements. You are offering something different: a metadata layer that sits on top of whatever storage (Dropbox, SMB, Git) the team already uses. That is a much easier sell to a CTO who doesn't want to migrate 10TB of data to a new startup's cloud.

2. The "Fatal Flaw" (Why I wouldn't write a check yet)
Right now, eng-dna is a fantastic single-player utility, but it has zero network effect.

The "Silo" Risk: As identified in your code review, the database is local-only. If an engineer leaves the company, their "lineage graph" dies on their laptop. No enterprise will pay for a system where data is trapped on endpoints.

The Monetization Gap: You cannot sell a CLI tool. You can only sell Collaboration.

Git is free; GitHub is a billion-dollar business.

DVC is free; Iterative Studio is the business.

eng-dna (CLI) must be free; eng-dna Hub (the server that syncs the graph) is the product.

3. The Commercial Roadmap (How to make this fundable)
If you want to turn this from a cool script into a venture-backed company, here is the pivot you need to articulate:

Phase 1: The "Trojan Horse" (Current State)
Goal: adoption.

Strategy: Keep the CLI open-source and free. Let engineers at Tesla, Dyson, and startups use it secretly on their laptops because it solves their immediate pain (Where did this file come from?).

Metric: Number of "DNA tokens" generated.

Phase 2: The "Tax" (The Missing Product)
The Problem you create: Once 5 engineers on a team use edna, they will desperately want to see each other's lineage graphs. "Did John validate this rotor geometry yet?"

The Product: Eng-DNA Hub.

A lightweight Docker container (self-hosted) or SaaS.

The CLI pushes the metadata (not the heavy files) to this hub.

Value Prop: "For $30/user/month, see the entire design history of your team in one searchable dashboard, without moving your files from their secure on-prem storage."

4. Investor Verdict
Technology: B+ (Solid architecture, proven "Sidecar" pattern).

Market Timing: A+ (Hardware is becoming "Agile", but tools are stuck in the 90s).

Business Model: C- (Currently non-existent. You need the "Hub" strategy).

Bottom Line: I would not fund eng-dna as a standalone CLI tool. However, if you pitched this as "The Metadata Backbone for Agile Hardware," using the open-source CLI as a zero-cost customer acquisition channel for an Enterprise Knowledge Graph, I would be extremely interested.

Your immediate next step: Do not build more CLI features. Build the "Export/Import" function or a prototype "Sync Server." Prove that two people can share a graph. That is your Minimum Viable Business.
