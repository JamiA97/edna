Ideas to improve edna  

1. Currently we have to start a virtual environment (venv) to get the program to work. Can we just have to program run using bash without the .venv
2. We should be able to easily see all the 'projects' that are in the db.
3. Have an 'edna' command which lists files in a folder but ignores any '.edna' files, like 'ls --ignore="*.edna"'
